# ARCOS

The file header.tsv has the headers, which are not present in the other files.
The data is stored in multi-part 7zip format. 
There is one batch of files for each 1st digit of the 3-zip. So to download all the files necessary to unzip, for example, all data for 3zip 0xx, get files arcos_0xx.7z.001 through arcos_0xx.7z.006. Then open arcos_0xx.7z.001 with 7zip and unzip.
